# Selecting-Machine-Learning-Model
This program is used to select a machine learning model for the given set of data. The idea is to create an interactive program which will take in the data and return the name of the classifier which performs the best alongs with the tuned parameters.

Initially I just want to run an already preprocessed fully numerical data through various machine learning algorithm with default parameter settings to select the best performing model among them.

In next step, I want to add function for hyperparameter tuning of each of the models or just select the model with performed best with default parameters and than tuned its parameters.

This two steps will be the backbone of the entire program. Later on some preprocessing funtions will be added and many more modifications as required in the preprocessing stage.
